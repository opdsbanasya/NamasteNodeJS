## **What?**

- Node.js is anÂ `open-source`,Â `cross-platform`,Â `JavaScript runtime environment`Â that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- Node.js is built on top of theÂ `V8 JavaScript engine`, which is the engine that runsÂ `Google Chrome`.
- Node.js uses anÂ `event-driven`,Â `non-blocking I/O`Â model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
- Whenever there is JavaScript, there is Node.js.

## **Need?**

- Before node.js, there wasÂ `Apache HTTP Server`Â used to run server-side code, but it wasÂ `blocking I/O`Â model.
- `Ryan Dahl`Â (creator of Node.js) wanted to build a server that could handle many connections at the same time.
- Node.js is very fast because it uses the V8 engine, which is written in C++ and is very fast.

## **History**

- Node.js was written initially byÂ `Ryan Dahl`Â inÂ `2009`.
- Initially, Ryan Dahl usesÂ `Firefox's SpiderMonkey`Â engine to run JavaScript code, but after 2 days he switched toÂ `Google's V8 engine`.
- Initially, Ryan work independently. There is a company calledÂ `Joyent`Â which work similar, they try to use JavaScript on the server-side, very impressed with Ryan Dahl's work and they hired him.
- Now Ryan works with Joyent. In the starting phase, they used it internally. Ryan named itÂ `Web.js`Â to build web servers. Later, he understood that Node is not limited to web servers; it can be used for any kind of application, and he named itÂ `Node.js`.
- In 2010,Â `NPM`Â created byÂ `Isaac Z. Schlueter`, it is aÂ `package manager`Â for Node.js there anybody can publish their package. This is like aÂ `web registry`Â for Node.js packages and very significant for the Node.js ecosystem.
- Initially, Node.js was supported only onÂ `Linux`Â andÂ `MacOS`, but in 2011, there wasÂ `Windows`Â support that was led byÂ `Joyent`Â andÂ `Microsoft`.
- In 2012,Â `Ryan Dahl`Â stepped down from the project andÂ `Isaac`Â took over the project. Now, pace of development of Node.jsÂ `very slow`Â and chrome releases new version of V8 engine day by day.
- In 2014, A developer namedÂ `Fedor Indunty`Â created aÂ `fork`Â of Node.js calledÂ `io.js`Â because he was not happy with the pace of development of Node.js. Now, there aÂ `controversy`Â between Node.js and io.js. Joyent managing Node.js but is open source. Joyent was limiting theÂ `release cycle`, so the development process became slow, and the node was going toÂ `die`, it was not actively maintained.
- Now there 2 different versions of Node.js,Â `Node.js`Â andÂ `io.js`, both have different release cycles and development versions, this messed up the Node.js ecosystem.
- In 2015,Â `Jayent`Â andÂ `io.js`Â being merged andÂ `Node.js Foundation`Â was created. Now Node.js is actively maintained by the Node.js Foundation.
- In 2019, there 2 commitiesÂ `JavaScript Foundation`Â andÂ `Node.js Foundation`Â merged and createdÂ the `OpenJS Foundation`.
